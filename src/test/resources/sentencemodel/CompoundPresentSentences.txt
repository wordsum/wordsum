I ran the track for I love running.

I spin circles yet I stand over you.

I hunger for dinner so I cook steak.

I sleep at night and I work during the day.

I lost war nor we won the war.

I fly the sky but I sink in water.

I shit in toilet or I pee in toilet.

I walk sidewalk as Bob walks stairs.

I walk sidewalk while Bob walks stairs.

I ran the track, for I love running.

I spin circles, yet I stand over you.

I hunger for dinner, so I cook steak.

I sleep at night, and I work during the day.

I lost war, nor we won the war.

I fly the sky, but we sink in water.

I shit in toilet, or you pee in toilet.

I walk sidewalk, as Bob walks stairs.

I walk sidewalk, while Bob walks stairs.
