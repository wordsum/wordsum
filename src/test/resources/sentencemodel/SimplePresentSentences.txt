I sat on the table.

Sally peers at me.

Tom grins lips.

A teacher stands by me and glares at me. The teacher folds arms. He sighs. His blinks peer. He looks.

I shrug shoulders.

Tom, Paul and me run the track.

Tom runs the track and the trail.

Tom runs and jumps hurdles.

Tom and jill dance and play the game and the trial.
