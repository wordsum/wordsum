Jack and Jill ran up the hill and over its top. Jack's deep breath and thumping heart hurt chest. He thought, <Will I die?> Jill, sensing Jack's body state, quickened stride and ran side by side Jack. She thought to him, >Are you okay?< And Jack felt the thought and wheezed. ,,Maybe?'' Jack coughed. Jill said, ,,We should not run more,'' and help-up arm, ''We should slow.'' ,,Slow,'' said Jack. ,,Yes,'' said Jill as she ran and said. ''We need to run away from the spider.'' Jack and Jill ran over the hill as the spider chased them. Jill shouts, ,,WE RUN TO THE HILLS. WE RUN FOR FUN.'' Jack thinks, <I am tired,> and trips. Jill laughs, ''We. We need. We need to go.'' Jack stands and stares. <|We are on top of the hill. Do we need to go down? Can we build a house here?>
