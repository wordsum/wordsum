She stands, ,,Right here. Right here. Here how I talk.''

John says, ,,I like to talk. I talk subjects.''

She speaks, >We speak in our minds. We talk with our minds. You will talk with us.< She flies through the sky. I don't talk like the first she,<

John speaks, >I like to talk. I talk at you. I talk short sentences.<

Then she and John run to Sue. And they stare at each other.

>|Hi, Sue.<

Sue smile. ,,Hi.''

>Here how I talk? Yes.<

>Yes. We should talk.<
