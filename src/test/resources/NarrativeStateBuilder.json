  "fileState": ",,Me brooder! We can kill the linnorm Fafnheir. We can unite the Linnorm Kings. And we can fight Baba Yaga from the lands of our people,\u0027\u0027 says Soarin Unterson. He throws muscled arm around his stout younger brother, Vlag Unterson, and says, \u0027\u0027But only if we don\u0027t fight each other and we don\u0027t get harassed by the Gendarmes.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag says, ,,And get into Riddleport to work!\u0027\u0027 \n\nSoarin squeezes Vlag.\n\nThe brothers round the third bend of Calphiak Pass and see a hundred feet away Gendarmes near a wood shack and fire guarding the entrance and haze of Riddleport. \n\nRiddleport is nestled between two steep ridges of the Calphiak Mountains and united by the riddles of greed, magic and Overlord Gaston Cromarcky.\n\nA riddle for newcomers to Riddleport is its law. One answer to the riddle is pay the Overlord Gaston Cromarcky.\n\nThe other answer to the riddle is befriend the Gendarmes: the mercenaries, extortionists and bribe collectors of Gaston.  Gendarmes trip many merchants and many pirates with their law and their guisarme. Gendarmes enforce their law with the blade of a guisarme. Their law is Riddleport\u0027s law: pay.\n\nThe Unterson brothers\u0027s first riddle of Riddleport is how to make it through Calphiak Pass into Riddleport without paying the Gendarmes.\n\nAs the brothers step closer to the Gendarmes and Riddleport, they leave their family a half-day\u0027s longboat row to the coastal south.\n\nSoarin and Vlag longboated from Unter Village over the waters of Varisa Bay during the morning after dad said, ,,Soarin, you are too big to feed. And Vlag, you are too wild to tame. Both Baba Yaga Sneak Attack each other much.\u0027\u0027 Both Soarin and Vlag knew it was time to make room for the new baby and the other six siblings. And Grandmother said it was, ,,The Time.\u0027\u0027 \n\nThe brothers packed rope, blankets, flint and steel, fish hooks and net, canvas sheets, waterskins and dried fish. They stuffed coins in pockets. Vlag pulled leather armor over hide pants and shirt. He hit spear against shield while Soarin dressed his bear skin fur over hide pants and jacket. Soarin swung heavy mace, said. ,,We journey.\u0027\u0027\n\nThey rowed from Unter Village to Riddleport on the longboat with father. Soarin and Vlag felt excited fear not knowing if they\u0027d see their clan again. Vlag knew they weren\u0027t selling fish, and Soarin\u0027s loins stirred at the tales of Riddleport\u0027s whores. The longboat beached the rough shore outside Riddleport to avoid fees and bribes and cast-off the brothers to earn their own way in the world.\n\nFather said, ,,Don\u0027t Baba Yaga Sneak Attack your brooder in Riddleport. Gives Gendarmes reason to take coin or beat you.\u0027\u0027\n\n,,Yes, faughter,\u0027\u0027 said Vlag.\n\nFather said, ,,May you come back on a Red Sunset.\u0027\u0027 \n\nSoarin and Vlag walked the shore from the boat to the trees and a one-wagon road North. They walked through Shoanti territory to the two-wagon road West to Riddleport. \n\nThe brothers walk Calphiak Pass.\n\nSoarin shouts, \u0027\u0027UUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNTERSON!\u0027\u0027 The pass echoes, \u0027\u0027...SON...Son...son.\u0027\u0027\n\nAlong Calphiak Pass before it opens to the smoke haze of Riddleport, a few Gendarmes pull their blood red cloaks over shoulders. They look through smoldering peat smoke, rub their hands, swat large mosquitoes and look at the approaching Unterson brothers. A bearded Gendarme points tip of a guisarme at the brothers and talks too distant to be heard by the brothers.\n\nSoarin Unterson says, \u0027\u0027Me brooder, we going to make you a man. Oh yeah?\u0027\u0027 His muscled arm squeezes Vlag\u0027s skinny but sturdy body. \u0027\u0027Oh yeah, me brooder.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag\u0027s strong body feels the strength of Soarin, but not the pain of Soarin\u0027s squeeze. Vlag laughs. ,,Brooder, you hug like child.\u0027\u0027 He pushes from Soarin as Soarin releases squeeze. \n\nSoarin spreads arms through humidity showing his tattoos. ,,You may not be the baby, but you\u0027ve not pillaged a woman with your spear, so she can show you how to use it to be a man.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag pounds forearm against chest and thick leather armor. ,,I\u0027m a man. I know how to use my spear.\u0027\u0027 He smiles and nods. \u0027\u0027Brooder, you were playing with ladies and gramooder while I worked the boat with faughter.\u0027\u0027\n\nSoarin grins. ,,Oh yeah, brooder, I was playing with the ladies while you played with faughter.\u0027\u0027 He strokes his blond beard. \u0027\u0027He make you a man with your spear?\u0027\u0027 He reaches and rubs the stubble on Vlag\u0027s cheek. \u0027\u0027You grow a beard.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag pushes Soarin\u0027s arm and leans back and raises a fist.\n\nThey glare at each other then chuckle.\n\nThe gust blows the blood red cloaks of the Gendarmes starring through pungent peat smoke at the brothers.\n\nSoarin says, ,,It\u0027s just us brooders. No ladies. No faughter.\u0027\u0027 He flexes muscles and whips long braided locks of blond hair over shoulders. He steps along road closer to the Gendarmes.\n\nSoarin\u0027s hair is woven with beads given to him by his grandma, the spiritual leader of the clan. Soarin\u0027s spiritual strength was felt since birth. Soarin learned from grandma the spirit ways and life\u0027s paths. Grandma showed Soarin how to reach to Untersons of Time Past for guidance and healing. His body\u0027s strength came from father and from wrestling his brother. His spiritual strength came from grandma and the tattoos.\n\nGrandma told arcane stories while she tattooed Soarin\u0027s skin. She told stories of olden days when the fish brought word of the arcane to the shores of Thessalon. She recounted tales of seafarers listening to the fish and learning great power from the fish. She taught Soarin the great power of potions for fish need liquid while scribing the tales on his skin.\n\nVlag teases his older and bigger brother about Soarin being able to cook a potion in the kitchen, but not fish over a campfire.\n\nVlag learned to make a campfire from father after father pushed Vlag from the fishing boat into the icy ocean and shouted ,,BABA YAGA SNEAK ATTACK!\u0027\u0027 Then father showed Vlag how to build a fire. \n\nAs Vlag dried by fire, father told Vlag stories of their Linnorm ancestors fighting Baba Yaga from Hagsreach in the Land of Linnorm Kings. Once dry, Vlag would try to Baba Yaga Sneak Attack Soarin using quickness and surprise to battle Soarin\u0027s strength.\n\nVlag became tough from getting beat by Soarin, rowing boats and hauling fishing nets since he was twelve. He became quick by dodging his father\u0027s Baba Yaga Sneak Attacks. After seven winters fishing, Vlag is not as strong as Soarin, but he can take a beating if he\u0027s caught.\n\nIn the shadows of Calphiak Pass, Vlag says, ,,Brooder.\u0027\u0027 He steps with Soarin. \u0027\u0027Riddleport\u0027s dire seawolves attack those alone on the docks.\u0027\u0027 \n\nSoarin lowers spread arms and hangs hand by heavy mace. ,,Well, me brooder. If we don\u0027t fight and stay as one then we won\u0027t be alone.\u0027\u0027 He slaps Vlag\u0027s back. \u0027\u0027We make you a man. I won\u0027t be fighting with a boy!\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag sneers. ,,Yeah, Brooder.\u0027\u0027 Vlag raises spear and stabs space before him.  \u0027\u0027Have you, Brooder?\u0027\u0027\n\n,,Oh yeah.\u0027\u0027 Soarin shakes his pouch. \u0027\u0027We drink. We eat. We get you a tiefling whore to pillage. We find jobs. We become kings!\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag spits. ,,Tiefling is like Baba Yaga witch spawn.\u0027\u0027 Vlag lifts spear and shouts. \u0027\u0027I WON\u0027T STICK MY SPEAR IN A TIEFLING!\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag\u0027s voice echoes through Calphiak Pass to the distant clanks, thumps and laughter of Riddleport that sounds like whispers to the shout of Vlag.\n\nBy the wood shack, eight Gendarmes throw back blood red cloaks and grip guisarmes. The bearded Gendarmes by wood shack points arm and finger at the brothers.\n\n,,Me brooder,\u0027\u0027 says Soarin as he slams forearm against his chest.\n\nTheir feet stomp gravel filled wagon ruts.\n\nThe humid breeze blows the Gas Works\u0027 smoke and trash rot fumes from Riddleport through the pass to the Eastern plains.\n\nAs the bothers walk, four Gendarmes guards fall in behind the them.\n\nVlag grips spear, and Soarin lays hand on heavy mace handle. They walk with the four Gendarmes following close behind.\n\n\u0027\u0027Faughter can\u0027t guard us, brooder,\u0027\u0027 says Soarin. \u0027\u0027We follow Varisia and her land. We guard each other. Not fight each other.\u0027\u0027\n\n,,Varisia...\u0027\u0027 says Vlag. His head hangs as he looks from the dirt to Soarin. \u0027\u0027What we do, brooder?\u0027\u0027\n\nSoarin shrugs. ,,Bounty hunters.\u0027\u0027 \n\nVlag shrugs. ,,No, not me.\u0027\u0027 After a few steps Vlag says, \u0027\u0027We work a boat.\u0027\u0027\n\nSoarin strokes beard. ,,Not working on a boat unless we got no money. And I work with me brooder.\u0027\u0027 He swings arm around Vlag.\n\nVlag shrugs-off Soarin\u0027s arm and steps from Soarin.\n\n\u0027\u0027Oh yeah,\u0027\u0027 says Soarin. \u0027\u0027Be that way.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag clenches fist. ,,We need to work.\u0027\u0027\n\nThe brothers step near the Gendarmes\u0027 wood shack and Calphiak Pass\u0027s end in the haze of Riddleport.\n\nNow six Gendarmes stand before the brothers and four are behind.\n\nSoarin says, ,,We be body guards. Or we fight in Zincher’s Arena. Or be Gendarmes.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag chuckles. ,,It\u0027s Vancaskerkin Arena now.\u0027\u0027\n\nSoarin says, ,,You hear that from faughter?\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag nods.\n\nSoarin grins, ,,Gramooder says never believe what you hear about Riddleport.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag shoves Soarin, and Soarin stands as Vlag says, ,,You fight. I work on a boat.\u0027\u0027\n\nSoarin shouts, ,,We fight! I\u0027ll talk. We go. Make me brooder a man.\u0027\u0027\n\n,,A man,\u0027\u0027 says Vlag.\n\n,,Oh yeah.\u0027\u0027 Soarin says and smiles. \u0027\u0027You pillage a tiefling with your spear.\u0027\u0027 Soarin swats at Vlag\u0027s crotch.\n\nVlag shouts, ,,I\u0027M A MAN!\u0027\u0027 He raises fist and spear.\n\nSoarin shouts through the mountain pass. ,,WE FALL TOGETHER. THE UUUUNTERSONS.\u0027\u0027 As shout echoes, Soarin nudges Vlag\u0027s shoulder. \u0027\u0027WE FIGHT!\u0027\u0027\n\n,,DROP YOUR WEAPONS!\u0027\u0027 shouts the bearded Gendarme. \n\nGendarmes near the wood shack and campfire grip guisarmes and step to the brothers. The Gendarmes behind the brothers ready their guisarmes.\n\nVlag sneers at Soarin, lowers fist.\n\nSoarin nudges Vlag\u0027s shoulder. \u0027\u0027Or we go home, and you can pillage faughter with your spear.\u0027\u0027\n\nVlag drops spear, punches at Soarin\u0027s face and shouts, ,,BABA YAGA SNEAK ATTACK!\u0027\u0027",
