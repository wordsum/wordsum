# wordsum-java

### Purpose

wordsum-java is a tool to output a version of the wordsum-model's Text Model.


### Source

This repository contains the java version of wordsum 0.0.99. This is alpha now that it's no longer meta.

The code is raw. It began as objects building object models then it became static methods building objects. It began trying to learn a language while trying to learn NLP. Then it became that language didn't matter and the only thing NLP does is help model text, so I can model a story for a machine.

The code of wordsum is very far from perfect if it were a location. There are a lot of mistakes I haven't edited and rewrote for I have the text model in the state for me to move beyond and the text model, so I can model parts of a fiction story like character, plot, setting.

I reason open sourcing the code and releasing it to the world will encourage me to fix it else be embarrassed for its existence even if no human or entity with agency ever reads it.

### Requirements

Time and focus as well Java 8 and access to the dependencies. Gradle is required if you want to use gradle build.gradle, and the gradle has worked on my machine.

### buld, test, deploy

The build, text and deploy pipe line doesn't exists because it has yet to help model a story.

The build.gradle is a good start. It worked on my machine.


### The Most Embarrassing Parts of wordsum-java:

1. NlpState should be refactored to use json output features likely in Stanford Core NLP 3.7.0.. The NlpState and its builders exist this state because a naive writer of NLP and Java wrote code to perform Extraction, Translation and Load of the string output of the Constituency tree and Dependency tree because a serializable  model in Stanford Core NLP 3.6.X was not found.

2. wordsum hasn't been upgraded to Stanford NLP 3.7.0 as it has a breaking change to current version of wordsum-java and right now a story with what is outputted with 3.6.X. that current team of developer can handle.

3. The PunctuationState and TenseState in the TextModel needs rework and testing, but implemented enough, so one can later come back and fix the states as they will be needed for the Story Model.

4. The state builders are mixed classes of static and non-static methods building objects because of a naive writer decided it liked static methods because to it static methods offered a separation concern and has not found time to make all the methods static.

5. It's current regular expressions for parsing dialog only parse Word Prostitute(R) Dialog Mark(TM). It wouldn't be too much to add American English standard double quotes but the current developer team doesn't have the time as it models a story with the text model.

6. The current models are generated by executing a test method in the test classes.

7. etc...


If you want to write and edit this to be less bad then I would be in you debit as would society, so A.I. can read
our fiction and know what that means that would be cool.

And please don't use this to teach killing machines.
