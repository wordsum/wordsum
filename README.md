# wordsum-java

### Purpose

wordsum-java is a tool to output a version of the wordsum-model's Text Model. It is currently be


### Source

This repository contains the java version of wordsum 0.0.99. This is alpha now that it's no longer meta.

The code is raw. It began as objects building object models then it became static methods building objects. It began trying to
learn a language while trying to learn NLP. Then it became that language didn't matter and the only thing NLP does
is help model text, so I can model a story for a machine.

The code of wordsum is very far from perfect if it were a location. There are a lot of mistakes I haven't edited and rewrote for I have
the text model in the state for me to move beyond and the text model, so I can model parts of a fiction story like
character, plot, setting.

I reason open sourcing the code and releasing it to the world will encourage me to fix it else be embarrassed for its existence even if no human or entity with agency ever reads it.

### Requirements

Time and focus as well Java 8 and access to the dependencies. Gradle is required if you want to use gradle build.gradle, and the gradle has worked on my machine.

### buld, test, deploy

The build, text and deploy pipe line doesn't exists because it has yet to help model a story.

The build.gradle is a good start. It worked on my machine.


### The Most Embarrassing Parts of wordsum-java:

1. NlpState should be refactored to use json output features in Stanford Core NLP 3.7.0.

 This state exists because when I first wrote NlpState and its builders, their purpose was to perform Extraction, Translation and Load of the string output of the Constituency tree and Dependency tree. I couldn't find a model of output easy to serialize, too, with Stanford Core NLP 3.6.X.

2. I haven't upgraded to Stanford NLP 3.7.0 as it has a breaking change to current version of wordsum-java, and right now I want to model a story with what is outputted with 3.6.X.

3. I have ideas like PunctuationState and TenseState in the TextModel that need work and testing, but implemented enough that I can later come back and fix the states once I need them to model TimeState after CharacterState is modelled.

4. I should have all the state builders be classes of static methods instead of the the mixed attempt to try both methods of building models. even though it is not best practices, but that would require time I'd need to code the model of a story.

5. It's current regular expressions for parsing dialog only parse Word Prostitute(R) Dialog Mark(TM). It wouldn't be too much to add American English standard double quotes, but I don't have time.

6. The current models are generated by executing a test method in the test classes.

7. etc...


If you want to write and edit this to be less bad then I would be in you debit as would society, so A.I. can read
our fiction and know what that means that would be cool.

And please don't use this to teach killing machines.
